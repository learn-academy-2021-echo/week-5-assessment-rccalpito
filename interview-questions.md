## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: Restful routes are routes that provide mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put delete, patch) to CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). These routes depend on HTTP verb and url.

3. ERB: stands for embedded ruby. File extensions with .erb show that they have ruby code embedded in them. Rails will evaluate the code to output an HTML file for rendering.

4. Params:Params in ruby are short for parameter. These parameters can send data to web applications to access form and URL query data. Param is a method that returns an ActionController::Parameter object. 

5. API:An applications programming interface is an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to one another. You can imagine a set of tools that someone owns. You are allowed to use these tools if you know the handshake. After performing the perfect handshake, you can use these tools within your own program.
